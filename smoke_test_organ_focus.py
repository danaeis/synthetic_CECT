"""
Synthetic smoke test for organ-focused patch sampling in CTPairDataset.

No real data: writes tiny NIfTI NCCT/CECT/seg triples where the seg marks a
small off-centre organ blob, then checks that with organ_focus_frac>0 a large
share of sampled patches actually overlap the organ (vs the legacy uniform grid,
which mostly misses it). Runs on the box or locally if nibabel is installed.
